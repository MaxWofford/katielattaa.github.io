                <p>The Umpa Lumpa: The Umpa Lumpa fools all, but his brain is so, so small. The Umpa Lumpa has the strangest hair; it is thin, yet coarse, but remains transparent like air. The Umpa Lumpa is as tan as can be, and he still wishes he can be
                    humane like me. The Umpa Lumpa just needs green hair; but he remains incredibly racist and unfair. The Umpa Lumpa's arguments are invalid which leaves him deserving no palace. The Umpa Lumpa is caught up in his narcissism, and won't
                    even respect the pope of Catholicism. The Umpa Lumpa angries the peaceful clouds, yet he still gets votes from the raging crowds.</p>

                <h2>Trump Better Listen</h2>
                <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
                    nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that
                    that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
                    here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here
                    to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
                    for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people,
                    by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

                <h2>Trump's Reality</h2>
                <p>Trump is not great, he sucks. Trump wil never be great, he will always suck. Trump's face is orange, yet he is racist against colored people and he is not even WHITE. Also Trump's hair is revolting. It looks likes angel hair pasta. Also,
                    look at his wife. She is what maybe the the age of his VERY OWN DAUGHTER!!!!!!! Trump.....America is currentl great and your presidency will make the country turn into a big piece of orange angel hair shit.</p>
